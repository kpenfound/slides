# Self Healing CI

Have you ever dreamt of a CI that's always green?

---

## The robots have arrived!

Robots are writing code!!

---

### The feedback loops

oh no we already had problems and now they're worse

---

## DevOps to the rescue!

We already have the tools, lets put our powers to use

---

### Self healing CI?

What does that mean?

---

### Trust

A trustworthy system is one that we believe will produce correct output. For an AI Agent, it means it cannot ever give us what we've all come to know as "AI slop".

---

### Reliability

A reliable system is one that we know will consistently fix the problems in CI. The success rate needs to be so high that we're not still spending almost as much time debugging CI failures as we did without the agent.

---

### Cheap?

A cost-effective system means we're not sending our entire budget to one of the big AI companies. We must be able to self-host a small and specialized LLM capable of being trustworthy and reliable.
