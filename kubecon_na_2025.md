# CAPABILITIES, APIS, AND EXPERIENCES

How cloud-native projects can deliver consistent experinces to platform teams

~~Marcos Nils & Mauricio Salatino~~

---

## 10 years of the Kubernetes ecosystem

- Kubernetes has changed and unified the underlying APIs to define and run our cloud native ecosystems
- The CNCF landscape is made up of 237 projects
    - 26 archived
    - 34 graduated
    - 36 incubating
    - 141 sandbox

---

## The problematic platform

- Tools do not have a unified interface
- Tools are not interoperable
- Abstractions are leaky

Leading to

- Reduced iteration speed
- Prolonged timeframes to adopt new technologies

---

## Soup or Salad?

Can you

- Easily identify the components?
- Modify the scale of a component?
- Substitute a component with another?

---

## Capabilities, APIs, and Experiences

- Platform users need **Capabilities**, not tools
- **Capabilities** are platform features supported by specific tools
- Those tools expose **APIs** providing functionality to the platform users
- The collection of the capabilities provide a platform **experience**

---

## Interfaces, interfaces, interfaces

- Components of a category should conform to a unified interface
- Unified interfaces allow us to build modular platforms
- Modular platforms allow us to keep up with changing technologies

- Platform users need **Capabilities**, not tools
- **Capabilities** are platform features supported by specific tools
- Those tools expose **APIs** providing functionality to the platform users
- The collection of the capabilities provide a platform **experience**

Standard APIs lead to a healthier ecosystem!

Your platform should be a salad.
